[The Cleve Archers Junior Squad](https://blockhead77.github.io/flightpath/index.html)  website has been created to be an informative site. Showcasing the existing club's efforts, informing new viewers of what to expect and inviting those viewers to partake in a taster session or beginners course. As the site has been design to appeal to our juniors and new junior members alike, I created lots of clickable content to keep them entertained. I used the primary colors as found on most archery targets to give the site a familiar archery feel.

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/img/readme/wireframes2.png" alt="Fonts">
</div>

### Fonts
- As I was pushed for time I used Bootstrap5's baked in font family.
- I didn't want to detract from the content as juniors can sometimes struggle with reading.
- A simple font means that there's one less barrier to a junior viewers enjoyment.

### Icons
- I had intented to take my icons from [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)'s Icon library but time ran out.
- This is be part of futures updates as I loaded the CDN into the header in preparation.

### Colors
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/img/readme/target.jpg" alt="Color Pallette">
</div>

- I chose to use the primary colous of an archery target for my palette.
- I felt it gave a sense of visual continuity between the sport itself and the website.

### Styling
- For this project I used Bootstrap5 and created custom CSS styles to suit the theme.
- For this I created rounded images as the targets play a huge part in Archery and they are all rounded.
- The primary colours have been picked from the target itself and applied in a broad spectrum throught the site.

# Features
## Page Elements
### All Pages
#### Navbar
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/img/readme/nav.PNG" alt="Nav Bar">
</div>

- The Navbar is simple, providing only 4 options aside from the home.
- In future I will include a logo. The club hasn't developed a junior's logo yet.
- The navbar is sticky / fixed to the top so it is visible no matter how far you scroll.

#### Footer
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/img/readme/footer.PNG" alt="Footer">
  </div>

- At the bottom every page, mainly highlighting contact and social links.
- Nothing that detracts from the page content but there if you need it with clear defined links.
- In future updates I will replace the links with icons.

### Index Page
#### Eye Tracking Design
- By starting with blue at the top, with red text and gold/yellow at the bottom my plas was to encourage the visitor to follow the colous.
- Archers know the points scoring goes from blue to red to gold.
- I also used a gallery priview to grab the attentions of the juniors.

### Sign Up Page
<div align="center">

- A very simple page as I beleive visitors want to spend as little time as possible filling out forms.
- The form has validation and is fully responsive.
- I ensured the required fields were set so that a meaningful message is obtained.
